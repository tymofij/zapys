Zapys LiveJournal Client
=========================

I use it for writing my LJ posts and editing the last one. 
I rarely need more power.

The idea of this tool is to allow easy creating of pretty texts.

Inline Replacements
-------------------
The text changes while you type — so you can enjoy typografic rightness instantly.

    * proper quotes.
    * (c) => ©
    * (r) => ®
    * (tm) => ™
    * ... => …
    * з*їм => з’їм 
    * uses n-dash and m-dash

Markdown
--------
Easy tags:

**bold**
_italic_
--strikeout--

Easy lists:

* list item
* list item

1. list item
2. list item

The complete Markdown manual lives at http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

LJ replacements:
----------------
LJ:username becomes <lj user="username">
http://example.com becomes hyperlink "example.com"


That's all for now. If you liked the software - drop me a line :)
